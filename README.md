Portfolio for professional development, centered around my python projects

<h4>
 Introduction
 <h4 />
 <p>
  For the first two weeks of my live project with the Tech Academy I was working on the Python Project.  Our team was working on   developing a full scale MVC web application in Python using Django framework.  At the time I had joined the project much of the site had already been built so immediately it was a fantastic chance to jump in and start solving issues with existing code.  After a quick initial story to get to know the project I took on the task of building a calendar for the site.  With a lot of research and finding some helpful tutorials I was able to create my own functional calendar for the site with full CRUD capabilities.  During this project I learned a lot about time management and the workflow of and agile development cycle.  Our daily stand-ups were essential in helping me get real experience in working as part of a team on the same project.  With a lot of hard work, we were all able to deliver our pieces of the project on time, and through our team slack channel there was always a way to find help if you became stuck.  I am very proud of the work I did on this project and I learned a lot about how to deliver a product to customer specs.  Over the two week sprint I had a great opportunity to work as part of an awesome team of other junior developers and I am confident that I will use everything I learned in this sprint throughout the rest of my career.

  Below is a more in-depth description of the work I did on creating the calendar for the TravelScrape Project complete with images that show the code I wrote as well as the progression of the calendar portion of the project.

 The Calendar Story
 <h5 />
  <br />
  <p>
    Taking on the calendar story was a bit of a daunting task as a brand-new developer working on my first live project.  When I started there was not even a link in the drop down menu for the calendar so I knew everything I would be doing would be new for the site.
